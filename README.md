# tenzo.ID // A Spotify powered app.

Created to help you find the perfect music for your mood, tenzo.ID is a web app that uses the Spotify API to provide you with detailed information about your favorite tracks and albums.

Built using react, chakraUI and a whole lot of love <3  
Thanks to the Spotify API, and me, you can access metadata about:

/ **tracks**

details like _BPM_, _key_, _energy level_ and _loudness_.

/ **albums**

information including their _release date_, _artists_, _label_ and even how _popular_ they are.

## Try it

It's simple! Clone the repo, install the dependencies using _npm install_ and run the app with the command _npm run dev_.

If you don't want to go through all of that, you can check out the live version, which is coming soon, at [tenzo.tech](https://tenzo.tech).
