# //tenzo.ID

Created to help you find the perfect music for your mood, tenzo.ID is a web app that uses the Spotify API to provide you with detailed information about your favorite tracks and albums.

Thanks to the Spotify API, and me, you can access metadata about:

/ **tracks**

details like _BPM_, _key_, _energy level_ and _loudness_.

/ **albums**

information including their _release date_, _artists_, _label_ and even how _popular_ they are.

## General

I designed it using Figma and then translated the design into the components provided by [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), the assets used were also created by me with Photoshop, like for example the background textures.
It was built with React using Vite and TypeScript, and a lot of music while doing it.

If you want to learn more about the development process, you are more than invited to check it out in my portfolio! [tenzo.tech](https://tenzo.tech)

## Try it

It's simple! Clone the repo, install the dependencies using _npm install_ and run the app with the command _npm run dev_.

If you don't want to go through all of that, you can check out the live version, which is coming soon, at [tenzo.tech/id](https://tenzo.tech)
