# //tenzo.ID

Created to help you find the perfect music for your mood, tenzo.ID is a web app that uses the Spotify API to provide you with detailed information about your favorite tracks and albums.

Thanks to me and the Spotify API, you can access metadata about:

/ **tracks**

details like _BPM_, _key_, _energy level_ and _loudness_.

/ **albums**

information including their _release date_, _artists_, _label_ and even how _popular_ they are.

## General

I designed the user interface using Figma and then translated the design into the components provided by [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), the assets,such as background textures and images, were created by me with Photoshop.
The entire project was built with React using Vite and TypeScript, with a good set playing in the background.

## Try it

It's simple! Clone the repo, install the dependencies using _npm install_ and run the app with the command _npm run dev_.

If you prefer a quicker option, you can check out the live version, which is coming soon, at [tenzo.tech](https://tenzo.tech)
