# tenzo.ID, a Spotify powered app.

Built using react, chakraUI and a whole lot of love <3
Thanks to the Spotify API, and me, you can access metadata about:

/ **tracks**

details like _BPM_, _key_, _energy level_ and _loudness_.

/ **albums**

information including their _release date_, _artists_, _label_ and even how _popular_ they are.

## Try it

It's simple! Clone the repo, install the dependencies using _npm install_ and run the app with the command _npm run dev_.

```



```
